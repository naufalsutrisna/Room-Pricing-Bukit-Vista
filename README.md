# Room-Pricing-Bukit-Vista

Bangkit Academy Batch 1 2024 has introduced a capstone project track called the Company Track. This initiative allows various companies to propose real-world cases for students to solve. One such case is the Room Pricing Model, presented by a property management company called Bukit Vista. In this project, participants are required to develop a dynamic room pricing prediction model based on several factors. The primary objective is to accurately predict room prices based on the check-in and check-out dates.
